# hello-world-test
my first encounter with GitHub
This is my first attempt at using GitHub. I thought if I better understood the software, I would be better able to download and use some of the public software that is stored there. In addition, I often undertake various electronic and mechanically oriented projects that Might benifit from this software. Potentially, I will be able to use GitHub to record my work on the projects while also organizing changed that I will inevitably make during the course of their development.
